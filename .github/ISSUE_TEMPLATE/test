Use this template to create a documentation issue. 

**Note**: Your permissions or working view (GitHub issue or ZenHub) might determine which issue page fields you can access, but complete as many as you can. 

Include:

- [ ] Links to related dev issues and/or Design Docs (IEAM and OH); here is the IEAM design doc template: https://ibm.ent.box.com/notes/886318013520
- [ ] Links to documentation content to show *where* updates are needed
- [ ] Add a squad label from the Labels drop-down list
- [ ] A *detailed* description of the requested update

Complete the input fields (they differ in the Github issue view vs the ZenHub board view):

* Title: Make it short, but meaningful. Do not include release numbers in titles (you can add that as a label).

* Pipelines: Apply one of the following pipelines:

 - New/Future for for unassigned issues (it has no release assignment yet)
 - Backlog if the issue is ready to start work on
 - In Progress for issues actively being worked on
 - Review/QA for issues in technical review (if the issue is attached to a PR in reivew, it automatically moves to this pipeline)
 - Icebox for issues that are not currently in any planned release or on hold

* Assigness: The writer is filled in by default, but add yourself and others (if needed).
  
* Labels: Apply appropriate labels. **Note:** For issues that apply to multiple releases, use a label to identify the secondary (non-current) release.

* Projects: NA

* Milestone: What sprint is this work due for completion? 

* Estimate: Optional

* Epics: Select an appropriate Epic (the Epics menu is populated from the release Aha site)

* Releases: Select the current Release. If an issue affects multiple releases, add the secondary release as a label.

* Link pull requests: Apply a related PR if appropriate

**Add comments in the new doc issue**

Add all pertinent information, approprite links, attachments, stakeholder info, anything useful for the update.
